\paragraph{Goal of the project} \hspace{0pt}
\\
\\
The goal is to make an optimized solution for finding the shortest path in a vector-based geometry.
\\
\\
Instead of dividing the geometry into pixels, here points will be placed in a two-dimensional
coordinate, that will then be joined to form a chain of edges. Edges are then required to form
a loop - in other words - a shape. This shape can then be interpreted as a wall or non-wall.
\\
\\
Pathfinding algorithm should generate the shortest available path from point A to point B,
avoiding possible walls along the way.
