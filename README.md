Path finding in 2D vector geometry

A laboratory project for algrorithms and datastructures.

Algorithm for path navigation generates a graph, where nodes are reflex angles of polygons, and nodes are connected if there are no obstructions between the nodes. Two additional nodes are then placed as path end points, and the optimal path can be found by running the A* algorithm in the graph.

All algorithms and data structures were implemented in Java by me for the project. A documentation is included in the repository.
